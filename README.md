# Dungeon & Objects

The project is about creating a simple RPG game while learning OOP in typescript.

It's a game where the player has to explore a dungeon and find the exit. The player can find objects in the dungeon and use them to defeat enemies or interact with the surroundings.

It is inspired from an idea of Michael Kolling and David J. Barnes and from the Object-Oriented-Programming with Java course of the University of Roma Tre.

## Structure

The project is done through different versions. Each version is a step forward in the development of the game.
Each version is a branch of the master branch and the master branch contains the last version of the game.

### Version 1
Simple version, with low maintainability and low extensibility. It is a good starting point to understand the basic concepts of OOP.
